# HardcorePolice Mod

A tactical AI enhancement mod that makes police chases more challenging and dynamic.

## üö® Features

- **Dynamic Flanking** ‚Äì Officers are assigned roles (Chaser or Interceptor). Interceptors attempt to predict your route and cut you off from the sides or ahead.
- **Path Unstucking** ‚Äì AI recalculates paths if stuck, helping them navigate tricky terrain or corners better.
- **Arrest Logic Tweaks** ‚Äì Fine-tuned radius and progress speed for arrests makes evading a close-range officer nearly impossible.

## üß† Enhanced Awareness

- **Vision Cone Upgrade** ‚Äì Widened field of view and range allows officers to detect you faster and from further distances.
- **Optional Faster Detection** ‚Äì Officers require less time to lock on if you're in view.

## üèÉ Speed-Based Boosting

- **Initial Chase Boost** ‚Äì Upon detection, cops get a burst of speed to catch up quickly.
- **Distance-Based Scaling** ‚Äì Officers dynamically run faster the further away you get, with optional cap control to prevent imbalance.

## üì° Radioing Nearby Units

- **Backup System** ‚Äì Officers who first spot you will radio others in the area to join the chase after a short delay.
- **Staggered Joining** ‚Äì Prevents lag spikes by queueing officers one at a time into the pursuit instead of all at once.

## üõ†Ô∏è Full Configuration Support

All features can be toggled or tuned via an auto-generated JSON config:

- Enable/disable flanking, vision upgrades, speed boosts, and radio calls
- Adjust multipliers, detection speeds, and chase logic
- Safely reloads older configs and applies missing defaults

## üéÆ How This Improves Gameplay

- Forces smarter movement during escapes
- Makes police feel more coordinated and tactical
- Increases tension, especially with multiple officers
- Prevents cheesy exploits like looping buildings endlessly
- Fully configurable for realism, chaos, or balance

2. Drop `HardcorePolice.dll` into your Mods folder.

## üß™ Notes & Known Issues

- **Performance:** Lag with 10+ officers? The mod now staggers AI decisions and backup requests, but performance may still dip if you're being chased by a full squad. Consider tuning flanking or radio range in the config.
- **Compatibility:** Police vision may conflict with other mods that modify detection. Be mindful of compatibility.
- **Optimization:** Flanking option can cause some FPS loss depending on how many officers are involved in pursuit, this is being worked on.
